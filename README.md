Problem Statement
Write functions to compute Sum, Difference, Product and Division of two Complex numbers of the below structure.
typedef struct complex_t {
    float real;
    float imaginary;
} complex_t;

Guidelines:
Programming
-Do not use scanf functions. Assume test values for arguments to functions.
-Implement different functions for each operation instead of writing everything under main function.
-Create a header file, source code file and test file.
-Use Dynamic memory wherever possible.

Resources:
-Structure in C: you should know in depth
